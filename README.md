# Flask DevOps App

This project is a simple Flask application designed to demonstrate DevOps practices, including containerization with Docker and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Features

- A basic Flask web application that displays "Hello DevOps!" on the homepage.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.
- GitHub Actions workflow to build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before running or deploying this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/njange/flask-devops-app.git
cd flask-devops-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```plaintext
Flask
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application Locally

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to see the app.

---

## Dockerization

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t njange/flask-devops-app:latest .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 njange/flask-devops-app:latest
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to see the app running in a container.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`) to automate the build and push process for the Docker image.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Triggers**:
   - On `push` or `pull_request` events to the `main` branch.

2. **Steps**:
   - Checkout the code.
   - Set up Docker Buildx.
   - Log in to Docker Hub using secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_TOKEN`).
   - Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
   - `DOCKER_TOKEN`: A Docker Hub access token with push permissions.

## Files Explained

### `app.py`

The main Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello DevOps!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### `Dockerfile`

The Dockerfile to containerize the application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### `.dockerignore`

Specifies files and directories to exclude from the Docker build context:

```plaintext
.git
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
.env
```

### `.github/workflows/docker.yml`

GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD:

```yml
name: Docker Build and Push Docker image to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: njange/flask-devops-app:latest
```

---

## Deployment

Once the workflow successfully pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub, you can deploy it to any container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS, etc.).
